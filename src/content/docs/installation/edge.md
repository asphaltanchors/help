title: Edge Installation
description: How close to the edge of asphalt can I install your anchors?
---

Install our anchors at least 9 inches away from the end of the asphalt area. As one gets closer to the edge, the asphalt may not be as consistent, and the area over which the forces are distributed starts shrinking. Installing closer than 9 inches will lead to premature failure.
