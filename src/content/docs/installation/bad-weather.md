description: Can I install Asphalt Anchors in Hot/Wet/Cold weather?
---
Yes, the anchors can be installed in most inclement weather such as rain, heat and colder weather, with certain limitations. Once cured for 24 hours, the anchors can be used in *any* weather and temperature.

## RAIN & WET

**EPX3** can be used in wet and standing water.

**EPX2** must be installed in dry conditions. While the EPX2 is waterproof once it hardens, rain can dilute the grout mixture when poured into the hole. This can be caused by standing water in the hole, or by water seeping into the hole from the rain or from a high water-table in the area. If you are unable to fully dry the hole, use the EPX3 instead.

## COLD TEMPERATURE

**EPX2** adhesive uses water in the mix. If the ambient temperature is below 50F, use warm water in the mix, then quickly dispense the mix into the hole. EPX2 can not be installed below 40F.

**EPX3** adhesive can be installed down to 14F. However, you need to pre-heat the EPX3 adhesive package to 70F before using it. If the EPX3 is used cold (below 50F) it will take much longer to cure, and at subfreezing epoxy temperature the curing will not even start. Once the curing starts it is exothermic and will self sustain in most temperatures.

**EPX5** is the same as EPX3, but only useable down to 24F.

## HOT TEMPERATURE

Warm weather significantly speeds up the curing process of all of our adhesives. To ensure the adhesive has sufficient working time, keep the adhesive shaded and cool at all times. For EPX2, you can work in ice water during mixing. For EPX3, keep the cartridge in a cooler/fridge until use.
