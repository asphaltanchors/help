Our Asphalt Anchors are tested in asphalt with 3" thickness - standard residential thickness. Asphalt is usually laid in 3 layers -- the bitumen (blacktop) layer on top, a layer of compacted gravel, and the soil underneath. The blacktop layer is the one that determines the pull resistance of the anchors.

All our anchors are designed to go fully through the asphalt layer. You can use any of our anchors in 3" of asphalt.

The pull resistance of the anchors increases at a rate that is proportional to the thickness. E.g. the SP10 anchor is rated at 1,500 lbs. pull in 3" asphalt. At 6", the pull resistance is about 3,000 lbs.

Asphalt thinner than 2" has not been tested and, if the application is in such asphalt, we discourage the use of our anchors.
