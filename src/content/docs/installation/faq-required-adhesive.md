title: Can Asphalt Anchors be used without adhesive?
description: FAQ

No.

Asphalt Anchors strength comes from the unique design of the anchors bonding iwth an adhesive and the asphalt. Unlike concrete anchors, asphalt requires both a unique anchor and the proper adhesive. 
​
Our anchors are designed to install into an oversize hole, where the anchor drops in cleanly.  The adhesion to the asphalt is performed by the grout.
