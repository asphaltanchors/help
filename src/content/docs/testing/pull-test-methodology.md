title: Pull Test Methodology
description: Detailed overview of how we test Asphalt Anchors
---
Asphalt Anchors conducts rigorous pull testing to determine the rated holding strength of our anchor and adhesive systems. All testing is performed on representative asphalt installations to ensure real-world performance data.

## Test Installation
Anchors are installed following manufacturer instructions and allowed to cure for a minimum of 24 hours before testing. Extended cure time testing (up to 6 months) has shown no significant variation in strength, confirming that anchors reach full strength within the initial cure period.

All tests are performed on professionally installed PG 64-16 asphalt, 3" thick over 3" compacted road base, aged approximately 1 year to simulate typical residential driveways.

## Test Equipment & Procedure
We use a calibrated hydraulic jack with integrated pressure gauge mounted in a custom 3-point support stand. The stand measures 12" tall with legs spaced 18" apart in an equilateral triangular pattern. This configuration transfers the pulling force into the asphalt surface around the anchor being tested.

The anchor is threaded through the center of the jack. Force is applied gradually over approximately one minute while data is logged at 500ms intervals. Each test is video recorded for visual verification.

## Measurement Points
Three critical data points are recorded for each test:

* First Movement: Force at 1/8" vertical displacement
* Major Movement: Force at 1/2" vertical displacement (considered functional failure)
* Ultimate Failure: Maximum force achieved before complete pullout

We use the Major Movement value as our primary performance metric, as this represents the point where an anchor would no longer reliably hold a load.

## Rating Methodology
Each anchor size and adhesive combination is tested a minimum of 3 times, with many configurations tested 9 or more times to ensure statistical validity. The rated strength is calculated as 90% of the average Major Movement force across all tests, providing a conservative safety margin.

Individual test results, including specific anchor models, adhesive types, and detailed force data, are published separately with each product rating.

## Temperature Considerations
Published rated strengths apply to asphalt surface temperatures below 100°F (typically occurring at ambient temperatures below 80°F). Asphalt softens as temperature increases, and our testing shows approximately 10% strength reduction for every 10°F increase in surface temperature above 100°F. Users should account for reduced holding capacity during hot weather conditions.
