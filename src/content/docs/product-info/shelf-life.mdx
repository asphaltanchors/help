description: What is the shelf life of your adhesive products?

## EPX2 Cement

Sealed packages of [[EPX2]] have a shelf life of 2 years. Once opened, they must be used within 3 months. The key factors are moisture exposure and air. Even sealed, the cement can absorb moisture through the container over time, causing it to harden or lose its bonding strength.

Note that even if it looks OK, older EPX2 may have absorbed mositure and won't anchor as strongly. The older the adhesive the weaker the bond will be. 

## EPX3 Acrylic Resin Adhesive

[[EPX3]] has a shelf life of 18 months from manufacture. Each tube has an expiration date printed on it. After 18 months the product is still useable for roughly an additional 6 months, with decreased strength. For maximum strength installations ensure you are using non-expired product.
